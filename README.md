GPS
=================
#### Querying and manipulating gps coordinates
* * *

This is a Haskell library for querying and manipulating GPS
coordinates and/or trails (lists of coordinates).

Features
--------

- basic coordinate operations: speed, distance and heading
- advanced coordinate functions: addVector, divideArea, and point interpolation
- flat-plain geometry: circleIntersectionPoints, intersectionArcsOf, maximumDistanceOfArc
- Trail filters and queries including: total distance, time, average speed, convex hull, bezier curve interpolation and more.

The Future
---------- 

- Determine the "best guess" triangulation coordinate given an set of intersecting circles.
